## Create .env.local file

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following content:

```env
# Tazo Streaming Overlay - Local Environment Variables

# Get your pull key from: https://realtimeirl.com/
NEXT_PUBLIC_RTIRL_PULL_KEY=your_rtirl_pull_key_here

# LocationIQ - For reverse geocoding (GPS coordinates to location names)
# Get your API key from: https://locationiq.com/
NEXT_PUBLIC_LOCATIONIQ_KEY=your_locationiq_api_key_here

# OpenWeatherMap - For weather data and sunrise/sunset times

## What's Changed

âœ… **Switched to OpenWeatherMap API** - More reliable and includes sunrise/sunset data
âœ… **Combined API calls** - Weather + sunrise/sunset in one request (more efficient)
âœ… **Better rate limits** - OpenWeatherMap has more generous limits
âœ… **Accurate day/night detection** - Uses real astronomical data for your location

## Next Steps

1. Create the `.env.local` file with your API keys
2. Restart your development server (`npm run dev`)
3. Test the overlay page - you should see accurate sunrise/sunset times in the console logs

The weather icon will now show the correct sun/moon based on real sunrise/sunset times for your exact GPS location! ðŸŒžðŸŒ™
